    "    Most of the problem was straight forward except for one part which took up quite a bit of time. What I especially struggled with was finding a way to split the peptide into linear fragments. Initially my working solution was to use itertools and simply use the combinations() function in order to get my fragments, but I found after consulting the textbook that this doesn't work because combinations() produces combos of every possible element of the provided string, which waaaay exceeded the 12 possible combos from the provided example LEQN/NQEL.\n",
    "    What I sought to accomplish was finding a way to \"cycle\" over the given string. At first I wanted to Macgyver together a way to check the indices then subtract those values and add another string on top- something along those lines- but a simpler solution I ended up thinking of was to just simulate the cycling itself by doubling up the string, adding it together with itself. In the end the final solution was iterating over it in a nested for loop, with the first loop iterating over the entire length of the sequence (x) and the second loop iterating over everything after the first amino (y). The resulting fragment would then be the indices of x and x+y, so it wouldnt ever be iterating over two equal indices and also wouldn't ever go past a combo of 3 amino acids. This method also caps the indices so it wouldn't ever cycle across the peptide completely, meaning no duplicates. I don't want to think anymore.\n",
